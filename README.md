# Thermometry


This code is used to perform simultaneous PIV and phosphor thermometry. 

- Automatically corrects the image distortions and cross-correlation to obtain velocity vectors
- Perform sub-pixel estimations, median tests 
- Provides information on the quality of the image ( Beer-Lambert absorption etc.)
- Spectral intensity ratio method to perform phosphor thermometry (NOVEL), adaptable to different filter sets 
- Automatically selects the regions where particles are present. 


Capable of producing a velocity + temperature flow field.
